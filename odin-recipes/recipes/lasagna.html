    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with ingredients such as meat, cheese (typically ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and tomato or béchamel sauce. The dish is baked until bubbly and golden, creating a rich, hearty casserole with layers of flavor and texture. It is often seasoned with herbs like oregano, basil, and garlic, and can include various fillings such as ground beef, sausage, or vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

            1. Prepare the Meat Sauce:
            <p>
                Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a little olive oil and cook the ground beef or Italian sausage until browned, breaking it up as it cooks.
                Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sauté until soft and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.
                Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, sugar, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat and let it cook uncovered for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
            </p>
        </li>
        2. Cook the Lasagna Noodles:
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
        Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente (firm but cooked through). Drain and lay the noodles flat on a baking sheet to prevent sticking. You can drizzle a bit of olive oil on them to keep them from sticking together.
        3. Prepare the Cheese Mixture:
        In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta (or cottage cheese), egg, grated Parmesan, and parsley until well combined. Set aside.
        4. Assemble the Lasagna:
        Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a large baking dish (9x13 inches), spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking.
        Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce (about 3 noodles, slightly overlapping).
        Spread about 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
        Add about 1/3 of the meat sauce on top of the ricotta.
        Sprinkle about 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella on top of the sauce.
        Repeat the layering process two more times: noodles, ricotta, meat sauce, mozzarella.
        For the final layer, top with noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        5. Bake:
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from browning too quickly).
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
        Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
        6. Let it Rest:
        Once baked, let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows it to set and makes it easier to cut into neat slices.
